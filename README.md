# `anrproxy`

Android Netrunner is no longer supported by Fantasy Flight Games any longer due to licensing issues with Wizards of the Coast.
If you're a new player and you find this glorious game, is it possible to get cards?
As FFG can't sell them, your only option is to print them yourself (and put them into sleeves with other cards), or to send them to a printing company.
Either way, you need access to the card's images, and a way to print out collections of them corresponding to a deck.

`anrproxy` generates pdfs of all cards in a deck to be printed out.
Decks are specified using [jinteki.net](https://jinteki.net) deck lists that can (should!) be generated with [netrunnerdb.com](https://netrunnerdb.com).

# Netrunner a dead game?

Though FFG is no longer supporting the game, [NISEI](https://stimhack.com/introducing-nisei-a-fan-organization-dedicated-to-continuing-netrunner/) is a fan organization dedicated to continuing the game.
This will include organized play (tournaments), new cards, and new formats.
`anrproxy` exists to hopefully become a simple proxy generator for new creative content for NISEI as well.

[jinteki.net](https://jinteki.net) is great for online play and is a great way to try out the game.
There are still a number of meet-ups for the game around the globe, and [netrunnit](https://netrunner.reddit.com) might be a good play to find out if there is one near you.
